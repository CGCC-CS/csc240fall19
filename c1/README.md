### strings.c
Examples of string handling in C.  C does not have a built-in string type.  Instead, strings are represented as null-terminated char arrays.  Also includes examples of initializing a string vs. a character array.  

### functions.c
Examples of calling functions in C, including passing paremeters by pointer (reference).  Forward declarations. 

### countspaces.c
An example of calling a function with an array pointer.  We have to pass the length of the array to the function so the loop will know when to stop.  Also examples of getting string input from the user using fgets, a symbolic constant, and scanning through an array.

### datatypes.c
Examples of different data types built in to C and how we can work with them.  Also included are examples of printf control sequences (additional control sequences are in the C notes).
