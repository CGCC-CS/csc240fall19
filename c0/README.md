###hello.c
A hello world example.

### inputoutput.c
An exmaple of getting user input in C using scanf.  Note that this is not the best way to do it, but will suffice at first.  The scanf function takes a pointer to a variable as its parameter so we need to pass the address (&) of the variable.  We will go into more detail later in the course.

###control.c
Examples of different control structures in C such as loops, conditional statements, and controling loop execution.  Most of these are similar to what you've sen in Java.  

###datatypes.c
Examples of different data types built in to C and how we can work with them.  Also included are examples of printf control sequences (additional control sequences are in the C notes).
